Contains project files for an Artificial Intelligence course taken at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Sweden, Fall of 2018.


HMMS Directory contains implementation of different Hidden Markov algorithms increasing in comlexity from 1-3. Implenting Markov chains,
the forward algorithm, and the Viterbi Algorithm.

TICTACTOE directory contains files which implements an AI to play 4x4 tictactoe using the minimax algorithm. 
PLEASE NOTE: as this was a class project, much of the core structure of the project was given to us while the implementation
of the logic behind performing moves was left to us to implement and fill out. Much of the GameState was implemented already as it 
concerned how the board looks and functions. Such methods are as follows: GameState, rowColumntoCell, at, sert, checkLine(s), and try Move.

The primary logic of the game was implemented by me and a fellow student at KTH university.
